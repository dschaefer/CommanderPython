# Python for the Commander X16

This is a python runtime for the WDC 65816 8/16-bit processor that will be used for the Commander X16 modern retro computer.

Until an emulator becomes available for that, we are targeting the Commodore 64 with the SuperCPU expansion pack as emulated by the VICE emulator. Sounds like this will be really close to what we'll expect in the X16.
